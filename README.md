# 🚗 Car Price Analysis  

This project explores factors influencing car prices using Python.  
The goal was to identify key drivers in price such as mileage, engine size, fuel type, and year of manufacture.

---

##  Project Overview  
- Cleaned and prepared car sales data for analysis  
- Explored relationships between price and key variables  
- Built a **regression model** to predict car prices  
- Visualized trends such as **price vs. fuel type**, **price vs. year**, and **price vs. mileage**

---

##  Tools & Libraries  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**

---

##  Dataset Columns  
| Column | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Manufacturer | Brand of the car |
| Model | Specific car model |
| Engine size | Engine capacity |
| Fuel type | Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, etc. |
| Year of manufacture | Production year |
| Mileage | Distance the car has traveled |
| Price | Market or resale value |

---

##  Key Insights  
- Newer cars with **larger engines** tend to have higher prices.  
- **Mileage** has an inverse relationship with car price.  
- Certain **fuel types** show stronger value retention over time.
